# Sort the People
### Date: 22-07-2024

## Intuition
The key to solving this problem is using the index of the array of strings to sort people by their heights in descending order. The idea is to iteratively find the person with the greatest height, place them in the result array, and then find the next tallest person, and so on.

## Approach

1. **Declare Auxiliary Values:**
    - We need an auxiliary value `heightCompared` to store the last compared height. This ensures we are always finding the tallest person who hasn't been placed in the result array yet. Initially, this should be set to the maximum value permitted in the language (`INT_MAX`).
    - We also need `tallerIndex` to store the index of the currently tallest person we find.
    - Declare the `result` array and an index `resultIndex` to update the values in the array.

2. **Iterate Over the Heights:**
    - For each iteration, initialize `actualHeight` to the minimum possible value (`INT_MIN`).
    - Iterate over the heights array. For each height, if it is greater than `actualHeight` but less than `heightCompared`, update `actualHeight` and `tallerIndex` to the current height and index, respectively.
    - Once the tallest height for the current iteration is found, update `heightCompared` to `actualHeight` and place the corresponding name in `result[resultIndex++]`.
    - Repeat the process until all names are placed in the result array.

## Complexity

### Time Complexity

**O(N^2)**

- This is because for each person, we iterate through the entire list of heights to find the next tallest person.

### Space Complexity

**O(N)**

- This accounts for the space needed to store the result array.
