# Find Valid Matrix Given Row and Column Sums
### Date: 20-07-2024

## Intuition
The problem requires constructing a matrix that satisfies given row and column sums. The challenge is to allocate values to the matrix such that the sum of the elements in each row matches the corresponding value in the `rowSum` array, and the sum of the elements in each column matches the corresponding value in the `colSum` array. I initially thought that placing the smallest possible value in each cell without exceeding the respective row and column sums would work.

## Approach

1. **Initialize the Matrix:**
    - Create a 2D array `result` with dimensions `rowSumSize` x `colSumSize`.
    - Initialize `returnSize` and `returnColumnSizes` to store the dimensions of the resulting matrix.

2. **Allocate Values:**
    - Iterate through each cell of the matrix.
    - For each cell `(i, j)`, set the value to the minimum of `rowSum[i]` and `colSum[j]`. This ensures that neither the row sum nor the column sum is exceeded.
    - Subtract this value from both `rowSum[i]` and `colSum[j]` to update the remaining sums.

## Complexity

### Time Complexity

**O(n * m)**

- Where `n` is the number of rows (`rowSumSize`) and `m` is the number of columns (`colSumSize`). This is because each cell in the matrix is visited once.

### Space Complexity

**O(n * m)**

- Where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. This accounts for the space needed to store the resulting matrix.
