## Intuition
The problem wants a list of numbers that gets the condition of being the minimun element in its row and maximum in its column, in this case called "Lucky Numbers".

## Approach
1. **Find Elements**: Find the minimum of each row and the maximum of each column.
    - Create a list for minimum `arrMin` and a list for maximum `arrMax` the length of each should be the number of rows and coulumns respectively `arrMin[matrixSize]`, `arrMax[matrixColSize]`.

    - Iterate over the matrix using an aux variable starting from the maximum and minimum number permited in the language `auxMin = Min` `auxMax = Max` *in c the library `limits` let us know this 2 numbers `INTMIN` `INTMAX`* then in each iteration confirm that the auxiliar variable is bigger or lower respectively about the compared number, if meets the condidition update the value of the `arrMin[i]` or `arrMax[i]` and the `aux` variable respectively

2. **Find the Lucky Numbers**: Given our list of maximum and minimum find the numbers in the matrix that meet the conditions:
    - Create a list that will contain the numbers that meets the conditions `result` and the index that we we will use as length of the list `resultI`.

    - Iterate over the matrix and in each iteration check if the number meets the condition of being the minimum in the row then confirm that its the maximum in the column, if meets both conditions add the number to `result[resultI++]`.

3. **Return result** Using C `result` must be malloced so `return` the `result (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * (resultI))`
