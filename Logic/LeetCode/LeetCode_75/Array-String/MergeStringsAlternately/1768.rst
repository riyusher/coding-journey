Exercise 1768: Merge Strings Alternately
========================================

Problem Description:
--------------------
Here, describe the problem (you can pull the problem statement from LeetCode).

Approach 1: Brute Force
-----------------------
In this approach, we alternate between two strings character by character.

.. code-block:: c
   :caption: C Implementation - Brute Force
   :name: C_bruteforce

   .. include:: 1768_c_code.c

You can see the full solution in C :ref:`here <C_bruteforce>`.

Approach 2: Greedy
------------------
In this approach, we take advantage of the greedy algorithm to merge strings efficiently.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Python Implementation - Greedy
   :name: Python_greedy

   .. include:: 1768_py_code.py

You can see the Python solution :ref:`here <Python_greedy>`.
