# Is Subsequence
### Date: 16-08-2024

## Intuition
To determine if one string (s) is a subsequence of another (t), we need to check if the characters of s appear in t in the same order, without necessarily being consecutive. We can achieve this by iterating through t and comparing characters with s, advancing the index of s only when a match is found.

## Approach
1. **Initialize Index:**
   - Create an index `sI` to keep track of the current position in string s, starting at 0.

2. **Iterate Through t:**
   - Iterate through each character in string t.
   - If the current character in t matches the character at index `sI` in s, increment `sI`.

3. **Check for Subsequence:**
   - After iterating through t, if `sI` is equal to the length of s, it means all characters of s were found in t in the correct order, so s is a subsequence of t. Return `true`.
   - Otherwise, s is not a subsequence of t, so return `false`.

## Complexity

### Time Complexity

**O(n)**

- Where n is the length of string t. The code iterates through t once, with each iteration taking constant time.

### Space Complexity

**O(1)**

- The code uses constant extra space, independent of the input string lengths.
