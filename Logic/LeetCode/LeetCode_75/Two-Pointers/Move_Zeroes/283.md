# Move Zeroes
### Date: 26-07-2024

## Intuition
The task is to rearrange an integer array `nums` such that all zeros are moved to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements. We can achieve this by using two pointers: `startIndex` and `endIndex`. 

## Approach

1. **Two Pointers:**
   - Initialize two pointers:
     - `startIndex`: Starts at index 0, keeping track of the position to place the next non-zero element.
     - `endIndex`: Starts at index 0 and iterates through the array.

2. **Iterate and Swap:**
   - Iterate through the array using `endIndex`.
   - If the element at `endIndex` is not zero, swap it with the element at `startIndex`.
   - Increment `startIndex` to point to the next available position for a non-zero element.

3. **Remaining Elements:**
   - After the loop finishes, all non-zero elements will be placed before `startIndex`. The remaining elements from `startIndex` to the end will be zeros (already in their final positions).

## Complexity

### Time Complexity

**O(n)**

- Where n is the length of the array `nums`. The code iterates through the array once, with each iteration taking constant time.

### Space Complexity

**O(1)**

- The code uses constant extra space for the two pointers, independent of the input array size.
