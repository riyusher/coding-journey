# [Merge Sorted Array]
### Date: 21/07/2024

## Intuition
We need to merge 2 arrays of integers in non decreasing order returning the result in the first array with the length of `nums1len` + `nums2len`.

First I thought handling the case of `nums1len` + `nums2len` == 1, after that all the other cases should be a matter of itterating by the length of the greater of this 2 lengths and ensuring the order of the merged array with aux indexes.

## Approach
1. **Handle Length 1 Case**:
- As we will compare 2 numbers in each iteration this wouldn't work on this case so we return the number that isn't `[0]`.

2. **Merge the Arrays**:
- With this exercise requesting the answer in the same given array we could compromete the array if we iterate from 0 to m + n length updating some value in another value of the same array, so we should update the values from the empty ones, meaning from high to low.
- Declare indexes for comparison, m, n and m + n;
- Each iteration compare the `nums1[i]` and `nums2[i]` if the `nums1[i]` is greater than `nums2[i]` update the m + n, n indexes, else update m + n, m indexes, so we fill the empty spaces until the returned array`[i]` is greater
